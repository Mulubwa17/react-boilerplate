The boilerplate will include but won't be limited to the following in categories

- [x] Routing
- [x] Basic tests
- [x] proper general project structure
- [x] BongoHive Consult Code standards
- [x] Code Linting

More will be added as we will see fit, we are not including a css framework at this stage, this will done after discussions.

## Basic Standards

- All code written will follow the javascript standards which can be ammended
- branches should be named after their respective features or issues they relate to
- branches should be deleted after review and a successful merge of a said branch
- If you find a rule that you don't like, file an issue and we discuss about it, just to keep the same standard.
- etc ... (More will be added )

## Contributing

Feel to create an issue.

While `npm` will work just fine, we strongly recommend to use `yarn`

To get all dependencies installed

`npm install` or `yarn`

To start the development server run the following command

`npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test` or `yarn run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

`npm run build` or `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
